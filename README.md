👋 Hi, I’m Diksha<br>
👀 I’m interested in web development and creating awesome websites!<br>
🌱 I’m currently learning  JavaScript to build my skills.<br>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects or contribute to open-source web development projects.<br>
📫 How to reach me:Chuphaldisi15@gmail.com<br>
😄 Pronouns: She/Her<br>
⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to make a website for my cat—she’s still waiting for her online fan club!<br>
🎨 When I’m not coding, you can find me binge-watching coding tutorials or pretending my coffee is a magic potion that helps me code faster.<br>
🚀 Currently working on my superpower: turning coffee into code!
